"""SneakersnStuff retailer scraper (Shopify, EUR).

https://www.sneakersnstuff.com exposes ``/products.json`` and brand collections
``carhartt-wip`` / ``salomon`` behind Cloudflare that returns JSON to plain
clients (no CAPTCHA). A full scan is cheap here so it is also enabled to catch
any brand without a collection.
